1.10	2016-08-09

	* Updated copyright notices to 2016.

	* Source: the configure script and Makefiles are generated from
	  autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.15.

	* Source: for the p117.test, we only check if the test passed, we do
	  not check for individual line changes, because depending on the C
	  standard library used we can get different results.

	* Source: Including mkwin script to build on Windows.

1.09	2016-01-23

	* Bug fixed: a program that called RANDOMIZE was generating the same
	sequence if the program was executed several times in the same second.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.08	2016-01-04

	* Bug fixed: do not accept a program with lines after an END statement.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

	* Added automatic tests for the NBS basic tests and some others.
	'make check' runs the tests.

1.07	2015-11-23

	* The fixed error in the previous version introduced a serious bug
	with TAB, as it expected a space after it. Fixed. Thanks to John
	Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.06	2015-11-15

	* Issue errors when a keyword is not followed by a space. For example,
	PRINT"HELLO" is not accepted now; it must be PRINT "HELLO". This is
	required by the standard. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.05	2015-11-03

	* Bug fix: READ had a bug for arrays with two dimensions: the data
	was read in the wrong slot. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for
	reporting this serious bug.

1.04	2015-09-04

	* Bug fix: running a program that uses DATA statements more than
	once in edit mode, now behaves correctly. Thanks to John Gatewood
	Ham for reporting.

1.03	2015-08-31

	* Catching Ctrl+C signal to break running programs instead of aborting.

	* Fixed reseting the print column to zero after input operations.

	* Implemented debug mode to warn about variables that are used before
	they are assigned a value. Documented.

	* Increased the print margin to 80 characters.

	* Fixed precision when reading numbers in some cases.

	* Better error messages.

	* Documented implementation-defined features.

1.02	2015-05-11

	* Paths passed to LOAD and SAVE were changed to upper case.  It was
	impossible on Unix systems to specify a lower case path.  Fixed.

	* When a file was loaded using LOAD, the spaces between the line
	number and the actual instructions were discarded. Fixed to allow
	indentation.

	* Fixed some compiling warnings that could cause problems.

	* The source distribution has been fixed and improved to compile
	correctly on Unix systems (not only on Cygwin).
