	* Fixed: bas55 now compiles without errors on platforms where GCC
          defaults to -fno-common.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* src/ecma55.h: 'union instruction *code' is now declared as
          extern, so it compiles when GCC defaults to fno-common. The rest
          of global variables were correctly declared as extern. Thanks again
          to John Gatewood Ham for the bug report.

	* bas55 now uses its own implementation of the functions SIN, COS, TAN,
	  ATN, EXP, LOG and SQR. This will make (hopefully) the results from
	  this functions to be the same on every platform.

	* bas55 now uses its own random number generator for the function RND
	  to get the same result on every platform.

	* Numbers are read up to 17 significant digits (previous versions were
	  limited to only 6 significant digits).

	* All these changes have been made in order to make bas55 behave the
	  same (give the same results) on every platform. Probably there are
	  still things to do to fully achieve that, but at this moment, the
	  tests bundled with bas55 give exactly the same results in the
	  platforms I tested (previously many of the tests were failing on
	  Windows due to differences in decimals or roundings).

	* Numbers are written up to 8 significant digits (previous versions
	  were limited to only 6 significant digits). Due to this the PRINT
	  zone length is now larger than before.

	* Multiple fixes to the NBS tests bundled. Thanks again to John
	  Gatewood Ham.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* bas55 now requires a C99 compiler to build. Come on, we are in 2020.

	* Added src/bmath.c: Here are all the mathematical functions
	  implemented.

	* src/vm.c: strtod55(): Bug fixed. We were using the 'long' data type
	  in this function and file. But a long is only 32 bits on Windows (64
	  bit on Linux). When the read precision was raised to 17 significant
	  digits, this was failing. Now we use the int64_t data type.

	* Added tools/newton.c. This is a small program used to calculate the
	  coefficients for the polynomials used to approximate the functions in
	  bmath.c.

	* Updated documentation bas55.texi.

1.17	2018-10-14

	* Updated project website to https://jorgicor.niobe.org/bas55 .

	Source changes
	--------------

	* src/Makefile.am using AM_CFLAGS and AM_CPPFLAGS instead of
	  bas55_CFLAGS and bas55_CPPFLAGS, which avoids generating object files
	  with prefixes as we don't need the feature.

1.16	2018-06-02

	* Fixed tests/chkout.inc which caused tests 36 and 161 to fail. We were
	  removing the path from error files and when the path was . , we were
	  using the regular expression ./ , so we were removing any character
	  followed by a / .

1.15	2018-03-08

	* Most parsing errors are now much more detailed, printing the line and
	  the point of the error. For example: 

		250: error: syntax error 
		 LET A=5**2
			 ^

	* Previously, using a number where a string was expected or viceversa
	  was reported as a cryptic "Syntax error". Now, these errors are
	  semantic, and we give more detailed information about what is wrong.
	  For example:

		270: error: string expression expected 
		 LET A$=X
			^

1.14	2018-02-22

	* Checking for uninitialized array elements now is possible in debug
	  mode.

	* More helpful error diagnostics: now we can show the name of the
	  variable involving an error (if any), as well as the array indexes
	  if for example we get an out of range error.

1.13	2018-02-14

	* Added support for the NetBSD libedit library to add enhanced editing
	  capabilities on GNU/Linux or BSD systems, like a history of previous
	  typed lines, command autocompletion, direct access to a line by its
	  number to edit it, etc. See the manual for details and the README
	  file to know how to compile bas55 with libedit support.

	  Note: This does not apply to the Windows version.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Updated the manual, to talk about the editing capabilites on Windows
	  and Unix-like systems. Also fixed some typographical errors.

	* Removed all permission notices from source files.  The license and
	  the copyright is at the top level of the project in the file COPYING
	  and applies to all the project except otherwise noted.

1.12	2017-11-20

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Fixed the P206.BAS test file which had typographical errors. Thanks
	  to John Gatewood Ham.

1.11	2017-04-04

	* Separating a long command line option from its argument using '=' now
	  is accepted, for example, `--gosub=10`.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Updated copyright notices to 2017.

	* Prepared for VPATH builds. This includes changes in the tests. Now it
	  is possible to compile the program in a folder different from the
	  source folder.  Still some tools generate files in `srcdir`
	  (*textinfo*) but that seems the accepted behaviour.
	
	* Added `bootstrap` script to regenerate the *autotools* files for
	  people cloning the project from revision control.
	
	* Renamed `ecma/` folder to `src/` . 

	* Added `-Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement` to the C compiler if
	  allowed.  Included the macro `m4/m4_ax_check_compile_flag.m4` to
	  check if the compiler supports that.
	
	* Fixed tests to work on Windows. Now we don't take into account end of
	  line differences. Still some tests don't pass due to implementation
	  diferences in the math functions.

1.10	2016-08-09

	* Updated copyright notices to 2016.

	* Source: the configure script and Makefiles are generated from
	  autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.15.

	* Source: for the p117.test, we only check if the test passed, we do
	  not check for individual line changes, because depending on the C
	  standard library used we can get different results.

	* Source: including mkwin script to build on Windows.

1.09	2016-01-23

	* Bug fixed: a program that called RANDOMIZE was generating the same
	sequence if the program was executed several times in the same second.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.08	2016-01-04

	* Bug fixed: do not accept a program with lines after an END statement.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

	* Added automatic tests for the NBS basic tests and some others.
	'make check' runs the tests.

1.07	2015-11-23

	* The fixed error in the previous version introduced a serious bug
	with TAB, as it expected a space after it. Fixed. Thanks to John
	Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.06	2015-11-15

	* Issue errors when a keyword is not followed by a space. For example,
	PRINT"HELLO" is not accepted now; it must be PRINT "HELLO". This is
	required by the standard. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.05	2015-11-03

	* Bug fix: READ had a bug for arrays with two dimensions: the data
	was read in the wrong slot. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for
	reporting this serious bug.

1.04	2015-09-04

	* Bug fix: running a program that uses DATA statements more than
	once in edit mode, now behaves correctly. Thanks to John Gatewood
	Ham for reporting.

1.03	2015-08-31

	* Catching Ctrl+C signal to break running programs instead of aborting.

	* Fixed reseting the print column to zero after input operations.

	* Implemented debug mode to warn about variables that are used before
	they are assigned a value. Documented.

	* Increased the print margin to 80 characters.

	* Fixed precision when reading numbers in some cases.

	* Better error messages.

	* Documented implementation-defined features.

1.02	2015-05-11

	* Paths passed to LOAD and SAVE were changed to upper case.  It was
	impossible on Unix systems to specify a lower case path.  Fixed.

	* When a file was loaded using LOAD, the spaces between the line
	number and the actual instructions were discarded. Fixed to allow
	indentation.

	* Fixed some compiling warnings that could cause problems.

	* The source distribution has been fixed and improved to compile
	correctly on Unix systems (not only on Cygwin).
