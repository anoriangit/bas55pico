1.11	2017-04-04

	* Separating a long command line option from its argument using '=' now
	  is accepted, for example, `--gosub=10`.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Updated copyright notices to 2017.

	* Prepared for VPATH builds. This includes changes in the tests. Now it
	  is possible to compile the program in a folder different from the
	  source folder.  Still some tools generate files in `srcdir`
	  (*textinfo*) but that seems the accepted behaviour.
	
	* Added `bootstrap` script to regenerate the *autotools* files for
	  people cloning the project from revision control.
	
	* Renamed `ecma/` folder to `src/` . 

	* Added `-Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement` to the C compiler if
	  allowed.  Included the macro `m4/m4_ax_check_compile_flag.m4` to
	  check if the compiler supports that.
	
	* Fixed tests to work on Windows. Now we don't take into account end of
	  line differences. Still some tests don't pass due to implementation
	  diferences in the math functions.

1.10	2016-08-09

	* Updated copyright notices to 2016.

	* Source: the configure script and Makefiles are generated from
	  autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.15.

	* Source: for the p117.test, we only check if the test passed, we do
	  not check for individual line changes, because depending on the C
	  standard library used we can get different results.

	* Source: including mkwin script to build on Windows.

1.09	2016-01-23

	* Bug fixed: a program that called RANDOMIZE was generating the same
	sequence if the program was executed several times in the same second.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.08	2016-01-04

	* Bug fixed: do not accept a program with lines after an END statement.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

	* Added automatic tests for the NBS basic tests and some others.
	'make check' runs the tests.

1.07	2015-11-23

	* The fixed error in the previous version introduced a serious bug
	with TAB, as it expected a space after it. Fixed. Thanks to John
	Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.06	2015-11-15

	* Issue errors when a keyword is not followed by a space. For example,
	PRINT"HELLO" is not accepted now; it must be PRINT "HELLO". This is
	required by the standard. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for reporting.

1.05	2015-11-03

	* Bug fix: READ had a bug for arrays with two dimensions: the data
	was read in the wrong slot. Thanks to John Gatewood Ham for
	reporting this serious bug.

1.04	2015-09-04

	* Bug fix: running a program that uses DATA statements more than
	once in edit mode, now behaves correctly. Thanks to John Gatewood
	Ham for reporting.

1.03	2015-08-31

	* Catching Ctrl+C signal to break running programs instead of aborting.

	* Fixed reseting the print column to zero after input operations.

	* Implemented debug mode to warn about variables that are used before
	they are assigned a value. Documented.

	* Increased the print margin to 80 characters.

	* Fixed precision when reading numbers in some cases.

	* Better error messages.

	* Documented implementation-defined features.

1.02	2015-05-11

	* Paths passed to LOAD and SAVE were changed to upper case.  It was
	impossible on Unix systems to specify a lower case path.  Fixed.

	* When a file was loaded using LOAD, the spaces between the line
	number and the actual instructions were discarded. Fixed to allow
	indentation.

	* Fixed some compiling warnings that could cause problems.

	* The source distribution has been fixed and improved to compile
	correctly on Unix systems (not only on Cygwin).
