# When you get the source from a version control repository, it is not
# ready for distribution. Some files have to be generated first but these
# generated files depend on the version of the tools you have on your system:
# autoconf, automake, help2man, texinfo, bison, etc
#
# You use this script only if you are a developer and you cloned the
# repository. You will need the above tools. This will generate some files:
# INSTALL, configure, some Makefile.in, etc
#
# This generated files should not be in version control. We have rules for that
# in the .gitignore file.
#
# After this 'bootstrap' you should be able to use the usual
#
# $ ./configure & make
