Unix like systems
-----------------

If you are building and installing bas55 from source on Unix systems, you can
find detailed instructions in the file INSTALL, included in the source
distribution of bas55.

After installing, you can type `man bas55' to see a brief explanation on how to
use the `bas55' program.  More detailed documentation, including a tutorial on
the Minimal BASIC programming language, can be found using the GNU
documentation system: type `info bas55' to read it.

Additionally, a sample Minimal BASIC program called sieve.bas, containing the
sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, is included in the source distribution.

Normally, after installing from source, you can find this on your system:

/usr/local/bin/bas55			The program executable.
/usr/local/share/man/man1/bas55.1	The manual page.
/usr/local/share/info/bas55.info	The info manual.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/COPYING	License.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/README	This file.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/NEWS		What's new in this version.
/usr/local/share/bas55/sieve.bas	The sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

If you are installing bas55 using your OS distribution package system, these
folders will probably be different.  Try changing /usr/local to /usr.

Cygwin
------

You can use Cygwin on Microsoft Windows to have a Unix like environment on that
operating system.  bas55 builds and installs correctly using Cygwin.

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

A precompiled distribution for Microsoft Windows is provided in a ZIP file.
After decompressing it, you will have these files:

bas55.exe	The program.
bas55.html	The manual.
readme.txt	This file.
copying.txt	License.
news.txt	What's new in this version.
sieve.bas	The sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in Minimal BASIC.

Double-click `bas55.exe' or open a system console and go to the folder where
you have decompressed the ZIP file and type `bas55'. Then type `HELP' to
see a list of available commands.  Double-click `bas55.html' to see the
program documentation in your web browser.
