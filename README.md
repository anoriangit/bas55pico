bas55pico - ECMA-55 Minimal BASIC System
=========================================

This is a work in progress of a customization and port for my rp2040 "tiny computer on a stick"
Please do not attempt to use this at this point: while the build files from the original bas55
project are still included, they won't be maintained any further (and probably removed alltogether soonish)
, the cmake based build for the Pico SDK is just a skeleton and the Visual Studio 2022 project files
(for my quikc evaluation system) are very much specific to my development setup and you won't have much fun
with them.

I'll update this readme once the project is in a state
more suitable for public consumption (I would turn the whole repo private, for now, if I could ;) )

Here's the original notes from Jorge:

`bas55` is an implementation of the *Minimal BASIC* programming language as
described by the [ECMA-55 standard][1]. `bas55` provides an interpreter and an
editor with line renumbering capabilities.

bas55 is free software. See the file `COPYING` for copying conditions.
