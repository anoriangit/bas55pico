	* configure.ac: Version 1.10 .

	* configure and Makefiles: Generated from autoconf 2.69 and automake
	1.15.

	* ecma.c: Updated copyright notices.

	* p117.test: This is an informative test. We can get different results
	depending on the libc version used. Only checking for passed test.

	* mkwin: Script to build on Windows under Cygwin.

2016-01-23

	* vm.c (randomize_op): RANDOMIZE was using time() to get the current
	seconds and init the seed. If the program ran several times in the
	same second, the results were the same. Using gettimeofday() in unixes
	and GetTickCount() on Windows. Also mixing the result so it is not
	increasing.

2016-01-04

	* tests: Added basic NBS tests and some others. 'make check' runs the
	tests.

	* parse.c (compile_line, end_decl): Do not accept a program with
	lines after an END statement.

2015-11-23

	* lex.c (lex_parse_id): the previous fix introduced a serious bug
	with TAB, as it was considered a keyword and the we expected a space
	after it. Fixed.

2015-11-15

	* lex.c (lex_parse_id): issue errors when a keyword is not followed by
	a space. For example, PRINT"HELLO" is not accepted now; it must be
	PRINT "HELLO". This is required by the standard. Thanks to John
	Gatewood Ham for reporting.

2015-11-03

	* vm.c (read_table_op): bug fix, the data was read in the wrong slot.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham.

2015-09-01

	* vm.c (run): the current index to the DATA elements was not restored
	after the program executed in the editor. Thus the next execution
	gave "not enough DATA elements". Added call to restore_data in run.
	Thanks to John Gatewood Ham.

2015-08-31

	* vm.c: increased print margin to 80 characters.

	* vm.c (print_num): factorized print_num into sprint_num that prints
	in a string and not in a file, so we can have the length
	of the generated string before printing. print_num uses sprint_num.
	Modified print_unescaled as well.

	* bas55.texi: documented implementation-defined features.

2015-08-12

	* datalex.c (strtod): not using pow. Fixed handling of
	0.700000000E+01 in NBS test 43 not being exact.

	* various: errno set to 0 inside parse_int, parse_double,
	parse_data_elem, call_ifun1 and others, instead of before
	every call. Fixed bug:

		10 PRINT 1E99999
		20 END
		run
		10
		error: invalid line number

	* various: better error messages.

2015-08-05

	* codedvar.c: added; functions previously in parse.c to handle coded
	variable names.  

	* various: Implemented debug mode to warn about variables that are
	used before they are assgined a value.

2015-08-03

	* vm.c (input_op): reset s_print_column to 0.

2015-08-02

	* vm.c (run): catched Ctrl+C signal to break running programs instead
	of aborting.

2015-05-30

	* edit.c (toupper_str): Including 'ctype.h' for 'toupper' function.

2015-05-28

	* grammar.y: Fixed indentation.

	* err.c (eprogname): Using PACKAGENAME as the program name and putting
	a space after the ':'.

2015-05-11

	* configure.ac: Check and for the math (-lm) library. The project
	compiled correctly using using Cygwin, but was failing in a real
	Unix-like OS.
	
	* doc/bas55.1: Man page generated when needed using `help2man'.

	* doc/bas55.texi: Spelling checked.

	* *: Removed DOS line endings.

	* ecma55.c: Using `config.h' package constants.

	* parse.c (cerrorln): Stop printing errors when E_BIG_RAM already
	issued.

	* vm.c (run): Less verbose.

	* edit.c (edit): toupper_str() changed after trying commands. The
	paths to LOAD and SAVE were changed to upper case, a bug on case
	sensitive systems.

	* util.c (toupper_str):	moved from edit.c. Made global.

	* cmd.c (get_range): `len' changed to size_t.
	(load): `chari' changed to size_t.
	(load):	fixed discarding whitespace after the line number.
	(set_gosub_cmd): `len' changed to size_t.

	* lex.c (is_basic_char): Parenthesis around conditionals.

	* parse.c (free_jumps): Removed unused function.

	* ecma55.sln: Removed.

	* ecma55/ecma55.vcproj: Removed.

	* /tools: Removed.

2015-01-31

	* ifun.c: Visual C++ refused to compile the release version when using
	a pointer to the `floor' function. Using #pragma function now.
